Optimal Transport - MBO (short tutorial)

We explore and experiment with the concepts introduced in the paper "Monge, Bregman and Occam: Interpretable Optimal Transport in High-Dimensions with Feature-Sparse Maps".
This repository includes a Jupyter notebook that covers both synthetic experiments as outlined in the paper and a basic application in color adaptation.

The paper presents a novel approach to optimal transport, focusing on high-dimensional data and feature-sparse mappings, enhancing interpretability and computational efficiency.
This notebook is structured to provide a hands-on introduction to these concepts, validate them through synthetic experiments, and apply the methodology to a practical problem in image processing.
